## Password Game

The helper is based on the game [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/). Regrettably, it seems the game rules aren't perfectly designed as they occasionally present unsolvable scenarios. 

## How to run

1. Clone the project

`git clone git@github.com:imhlq/PasswordGameCrasher.git`

2. Run the program
`python solver.py`

3. Interact with the program to solve the game.
